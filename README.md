# Hinglish-TOP-Dataset
Consists of the largest (10K) human annotated code-switched semantic parsing dataset &amp; 170K generated utterance using the CST5 augmentation technique. Queries are derived from TOPv2, a multi-domain task oriented semantic parsing dataset. Tests suggest that with CST5, up to 20x less labeled data can achieve the same semantic parsing performance.
